	<h3> What is this site for? </h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Learn how to make a website, from scratch:
			<ul>
				<li>I have done a good amount of <b>Wordpress</b> website building at work, but I wanted to go far deeper. Into the bones of how this all works.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Act as a repository for my writing. Hopefully acting as more of an incentive to polish up my rough ideas.</li>
		<li>Use this to tinker with various technology. Web dev stuff sure, but also whatever seems interesting that can be easily hosted on a site. Keeping this pretty broad for the moment. Will pursue whatever interests me.</li>
	</ol>

	<hr>
	<p>The name is just an idea that popped into my head a while ago. A kind of mantra; where I always want to be exploring new ideas, skills, and subjects. Anything that will potentially lead to personal <i>growth</i>.
