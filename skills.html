	<p>In <i>Time Enough for Love</i> Robert Heinlein wrote<sup>1</sup>:</p>
	<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man" style="font-size:20px">
	  <i>A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion,
	  butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet,
	  balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying,
	  take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations,
	  analyse a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer,
	  cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.</i>
	</blockquote>
	<p>I am a big fan of this quote.</p>
	<p>I am always taking on new skills, figuring out how things works, and trying to build my overall competance at a range of subjects. I don't really subscribe to the concept of mastery. Why would I want to dedicate myself to the relentless pursuit of perfecting one skill, when I could get to the 80-90% percentile <sup>2</sup> of a whole bunch of stuff?
	</p>
	<p>I am also somewhat of a nerd; I love the large sprawling skill trees in RPGs. I wondered what making such a skill tree would look like populated with my own skills? How would I group things? How to visualize it? Seemed like fun!
	</p>
	<p> So here it is!:</p>
