Small Static Blog on Netlify

No idea what I will be using this for at the moment.  

Current To-Do's:
  -Style:
    - Add in a colourscheme - see: coloors.co/generate
    - Figure out font choice. 
    - Create a nav menu/bar
    
  -Add in pop-up annotations/sources on mouse hover or click.
  -How do I have a universally-editable footer/header without needing to apply changes to all pages individually?
    -Also: is each blog entry going to just be their own pages? Might as well. 
      -Do I want a /blog/current_article system or just straight to /current_article?
