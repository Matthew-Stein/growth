Small Static Blog on Netlify

Personal website for myself, as well as a way to learn some basic web-dev skills.

Will eventually be a blog with more structured writing. Possibly host other projects in time.

Current To-Do's:

  -Style:

   - <strike>Add in a colourscheme - see: coloors.co/generate</strike>

   - <strike>Figure out font choice.</strike>

   - <strike>Create a nav menu/bar</strike>


  -How do I have a universally-editable footer/header without needing to apply changes to all pages individually?

   - <strike> Also: is each blog entry going to just be their own pages?</strike> Might as well.

       - Do I want a /blog/current_article system or just straight to /current_article?


**Changelog:**
  - 20/04/2021 - Got Netlify running and playing nice with Github.  
  - 20/08/2021 - Started dabbling with HTML
  - 23/10/2021 - Went through HTML&CSS library book (Sam's TeachYourself *HTML, CSS, and Javascript*) added pages, created header/nav/multiple pages.
  - 02/11/2021 - Style overhaul. Borrowed heavily from tinyprojects.dev - much easier to edit something that's existing instead of starting from the ground up. Good foundation. Actually figured out and got a better feel for how this all works. Linked pages together.
  - 24/05/2022 - Oops, let that sit for a while. Cleaned up the bio, home and bio was redundant. Blog should be the homepage.
