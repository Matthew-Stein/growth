	<h3>Hi, I'm Matt</h4>

	<p>I am a serial collector of new skills and deeply interested in a wide range of topics spanning the fields of science and technology, art, and the environment. </p>

	<p>
	I used to work as a canoe guide<sup>1</sup>, leading multi-week trips on remote northern Ontario rivers,
	but having finished a BSc. in Wildlife Biology & Conservation in 2019 (ask me about bees and I can talk your ear off),
	I now play in the woods full time working at a large nature reserve where I build and repair things all day.
	</p>

	<p>When I'm not there I can be found on a river somewhere whitewater kayaking or possibly tinkering on something in my shop/at my desk.</p>

	<hr>

	<p>I am currently working on:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Expanding my woodworking skills by building custom furniture for my house and hobbies. </li>
	<li>Improving my figure drawing and portraiture abilities.</li>
	<li>Developing my writing (and basic web-dev skills) on this blog.</li>
	<li>And trying to grow a bitchin' garden. &#129305 </li>
	</ul>

	<hr>

	<p>
	The name is just an idea that popped into my head a while ago. A kind of mantra; I always want to be exploring new ideas, skills, and subjects. Anything that will potentially lead to personal <i>growth</i>.
	</p>
	<p>It's a big world out there chocked full of interesting things!</p>

	<p>Please reach out if there is anything interesting you see on here or if you just want to chat.</p>
